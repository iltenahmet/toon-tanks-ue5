# ToonTanks

Control the tank to destroy enemy towers before they take you down. Use the WASD keys to move, the mouse to turn, and the space bar to shoot. I developed this game using Unreal Engine, using both the Blueprint system and C++.
What I implemented:
- Tank and camera movement
- Enemy turret rotation and shooting mechanics based on the position of the tank
- Tank shooting mechanics
- Particle and sound effects
